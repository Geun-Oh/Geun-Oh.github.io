## Open IDE with special command flag

I was always open my IDE, cursor with only `cursor .` command.

But I can also open it with additional keywords!

Like below,,

```bash
cursor content/posts/241010.md
```

Now I got one step closer to be a master of IDE :D

p.s. There is nothing special office tasks to write down here...
I think I should align myself what I'm doing and what I need to do now.
